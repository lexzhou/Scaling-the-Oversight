    "Welcome to this notebook that goes through the recent `bitsandbytes` integration that includes the work from XXX that introduces no performance degradation 4bit quantization techniques, for democratizing LLMs inference and training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn together how to load a large model in 4bit (`gpt-neo-x-20b`) and train it using Google Colab and PEFT library from Hugging Face 🤗.\n",
    "\n",
    "[In the general usage notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ge2F1QSK8Q7h0hn3YKuBCOAS0bK8E0wf?usp=sharing), you can learn how to propely load a model in 4bit with all its variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you liked the previous work for integrating [*LLM.int8*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339), you can have a look at the [introduction blogpost](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration) to lean more about that quantization method.\n"
